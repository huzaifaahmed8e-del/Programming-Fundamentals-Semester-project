# Programming-Fundamentals-Semester-project

This C++ project simulates a simple bank account over a user-defined number of months.
The program allows users to enter an initial account balance, a yearly tax deduction rate,
and monthly deposit and withdrawal amounts.
For each month, the account balance is updated by adding deposits, subtracting withdrawals, and applying a monthly tax deduction calculated from the annual rate.
The program validates inputs to prevent negative values, tracks total deposits, withdrawals, and tax deductions, and displays the final account balance along with summary totals at the end of the simulation.
